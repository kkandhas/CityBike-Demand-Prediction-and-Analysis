Steps to run the project:

1) Preparation:
From https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html download 3 files:
	“201510-citibike-tripdata.csv”
	“201511-citibike-tripdata.csv”
	“201512-citibike-tripdata.csv”
as training data, and 1 more file:
	“201611-citibike-tripdata.csv”
as testing data.
Make sure these data files and the code files are in your present working directory.

2) To get the regression models and results:
Open the iPython Notebook file “citi_bike_project_final_code_part1.ipynb”, and run all the cells. 

3) To see the visualizations for the output:
Open the file “citi_bike_project_final_code_part1.ipynb" and run all the cells.
A csv file “bike_left11_train.csv” will be created in present working directory.

4) The visualization can be done using the prediction result “bike_left11_train.csv” and testing data “201611-citibike-tripdata.csv”.
Here we did it using Tableau.

5) The project introduction and result analysis is given by “Group 3 - Final Report.pdf”
